  <p> Crabs are decapods which means they have 10 legs! Crabs are a very common food eaten by humans, especially places near the ocean. There are over 6,700 species of crabs. The Japanese Spider crab is the worlds largest crab measuring at 12 to 13 feet across. The worlds smallest crab are pea crabs which grow to be .4 to .6 inches. A group of crabs is called a cast.
  </p>
  <p> Hermit crabs, king crabs, and horseshoe crabs are flase crabs. Female crabs can release up 1000 to 2000 eggs at once. The lifespan of a small crab averages around 3-4 years but a larger species of crab such as the giant japanese spider crab can live as long as 100 years.

  <p> Whales are big animals. Humpeback whales don't eat for most of the year due to them living in the southern hemisphere they live off their fat reserves for <code>5.5 - 7.5</code> months each year. They migrate from their tropical breeding grounds to Antarctic , to feed on krill. Whales do not drink water. They get the moisture they need from the food that they eat.
  </p>
  <p> Whales are not fish, they are mammals. They swallow their prey whole. Blue whales are the largest animal on Earth. They can weigh as 200 tons and grow up to 100 feet long. Whales can be very social creatures and they interact with eachother through complex vocalizations. Some species form very complex relationships. Whale poop is one of the ocean's most important fertilizers

  <header id="header">Sharks</header>
  <p> Sharks don't have bones, they are a subspecies of fish known as elasmobranchs, which is a family including sharks. On record, we know of more than <code>440</code> species of shark that call the ocean home. Scientists estimate about 40 species of shark can tolerate fresh or brackish water environments. Like other fish, sharks have scales. Unlike other fish though sharks scales are more like teeth than skin and they are called placoid scales or dermal denticles(not to be confused with tenticles).
  </p>
  <p> Depending on the species of shark, a shark pregnancy can last anywhere from five months to two years. The spiny dogfish has the longest prengancy of all sharks, and one of the longest for all animals. Sharks have six senses. In addition to sight, smell, hearing, touch and taste, sharks have the sense of electroreception, which allows them to detect the electrical currents of other organisms.

  <p> Seahorses are monogamous, they often stay with their mate for life. Staying with one partner per mating season allows them to have more reproductive success. They are bad swimmers. Seahorse suck their food through their snouts similar to a vacuum cleaner when they are eating. If the prey is large, their snouts expand as they are not able to chew and have to disintegrate food whislt they eat.
  </p>
  <p> As seahorses do not have stomachs, they have to follow a strict diet including tiny fish and planktonic copepods. Despite their small size, they consume around 3000 crustaoceans a day including brine and shrimp. Seahorses use their tails to help them hold onto objects, this makes eating food easier and prevents them from being pushed around by the current. Humans are seahorses biggest threat, there is a lot of intense targeted fishing.

<section class="main-section" id="Jellyfish" >
  <header id="header">Jellyfish</header>
  <p> Jellyfish are <code>95%</code> water, they don't have brains, hearts or lungs. Jellyfish are a type of cnidarian. Cnidarian's are jelly-like marine animals which have radical symmetry and sting their prey using cells on their tenticles called cnidoccytes which explode when stimulated. Jellyfish have hydrostatic skeletons. They can simply drift along with the ocean's currents. 
  </p>
  <p> Jellyfish have very short lifespans. The Irukandji jellyfish can be as small as one to two centimetres with a bell only a few millimetres wide, while the largest species - lionâ€™s mane - can grow up to two metres wide and have tentacles as long as 36 metres! Jellyfish begin as a polyp, before becoming an <code>â€˜ephyraâ€™</code> and then an adult <code>â€˜medusaâ€™</code>. But, if injured or starved, or in water which is either too hot or cold, an adult Turritopsis dohrnii <code>(also known as the immortal jellyfish)</code> can drop to the seabed and become a polyp all over again.
